Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and its software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did the company want you to address?

For this project, our client was Artemis Financial, a financial consulting institution. Artemis Financial wanted to modernize their company and add extra software security measures to their platform. They wanted to address any vulnerabilities and weaknesses and help protect themselves from external threats. 



What did you do well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall well-being?

Several precautionary measures were taken to protect Artemis Financial from their security vulnerabilities. For example, a checksum verification was created to help protect their data through transfer, and a certificate authority was created to help validate that their information was secure and could only be sent to other trusted, secure entities. By enacting software security measures to one's codes, it helps give peace of mind that code is protected against hacking attempts. Software security adds protection and integrity to a company's overall well-being, helping to maintain a trustworthy reputation.



Which part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?

One part of the vulnerability assessment that was challenging to me was determining which vulnerabilities were actually false-positives. Although I followed the instructions to hide any false positives, it was still a little confusing to know whether it was done correctly or not. Also, without the code, it was hard to determine false positives just by looking at the report.



How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?

There were several ways that I increased the layers of security. First, I added a checksum verification to create a hash function value that helped to validate the data was correct and secure. In addition, a certificate authority was created to give a public key to the software. The SHA-256 encryption scheme was also used to help encrypt and protect the information transferred and stored in the website. Lastly, the https protocol was used to add an extra layer of security for the bank's online platform. In the future, I think all of these layers of protection will be useful to help assess and address vulnerabilities. The vulnerability report also helped to recognize what techniques should be used to add security to the software.



How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?

Each time I refactored the code, I ran the code again to make sure it ran with no issues, as well as ran a vulnerability dependency report to view all new vulnerabilities. I only used code that would be beneficial to the overall functionality and security of the software and tried not to add any "unnecessary" code that would negatively affect the functionality of the code.



What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?

There were many security practices that I have learned in this course that I will most likely use in future projects to make them more secure. These include checksums, CA's, and encryption schemes. In addition, I have never used the OWASP dependency check tool before. However, this was a very useful tool in finding and addressing vulnerabilities and weaknesses in my code.



Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?

I will be able to show employers my checksum verification or the public key certificate authority I created. Also, I completed a dependency report addressing all of the issues and requirements that were discussed by the client. All of these skills will show that I have experience implementing security features and show that I am aware of the importance of adding security to my code.
